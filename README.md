# Chip-8 Emulator

## Overview

This project is a **Chip-8 emulator** built using **C#** and **WinForms**. The Chip-8 is a simple, interpreted programming language, originally developed in the 1970s for use on the COSMAC VIP and other early computers. The emulator allows you to load and run classic Chip-8 programs and games, such as Pong, Space Invaders, and IBM Logo.

## Features

- **Emulation of Chip-8 Instructions**: Accurately simulates all standard Chip-8 instructions, including math operations, drawing graphics, and handling user input.
- **Customizable Display**: Renders the Chip-8's graphics using a simple pixel-based system. Supports sprite drawing and collision detection.
- **Keyboard Input**: Maps the Chip-8's hexadecimal keypad to the computer keyboard.
- **Program Selection**: Load and run different `.ch8` and `.rom` files directly from the emulator.
- **Debugging Tools**: Includes features for testing and debugging, such as opcode handling, memory management, and register display.
